So when is it okay to use lorem ipsum? First, lorem ipsum works well for staging. 
It's like the props in a furniture storeâ€”filler text makes it nice like someone is home.
The same Wordpress template might eventually be home to a fitness blog, a photography website,
or the online journal of a cupcake fanatic. Lorem ipsum helps them imagine what the lived-in 
website might nice like.

Second, use lorem ipsum if you think the placeholder text will be too distracting.
For specific projects, collaboration between copywriters and designers may be best,
however, like Karen McGrane said, draft copy has a way of turning any meeting about
layout decisions into a discussion about word choice. So don't be afraid to use lorem
ipsum to keep everyone focused.
